MDI-14.ARC
----------
MDI-14.ARC contains these enhancements:

1. MDI now issues an MDI_REQUEST_EXTENDED_OPTIONS WM_CONTROL message
   during desktop creation.

2. MDI now issues an MDI_NOTIFY_CASCADE_INSTANCE WM_CONTROL message
   during a cascade operation and MDI_NOTIFY_TILE_INSTANCE message
   during a tile operation.

3. MDI now issues an MDI_NOTIFY_ACTIVATE_INSTANCE WM_CONTROL message
   during document instance activation and MDI_NOTIFY_DEACTIVATE_INSTANCE
   message during document instance deactivation.

4. When the desktop is closed, MDI first issues an
   MDI_INHIBIT_CLOSE_DESKTOP message to the desktop. If the desktop
   allows the close, MDI now polls all open documents and
   issues an MDI_INHIBIT_CLOSE_INSTANCE message. Only if all documents
   do not inhibit the close is the desktop closed.

5. MDI now supports the MDI_MSG_SET_DESKTOP_TITLE and
   MDI_MSG_SET_INSTANCE_TITLE messages.

MDI-14 fixes these bugs:

1. A bug in which a document's system menu is repainted incorrectly
   after a tile or cascade operation is fixed.
