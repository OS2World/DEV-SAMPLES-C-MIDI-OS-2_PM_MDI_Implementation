MDI-13.ARC
----------
MDI-13.ARC contains these enhancements:

1. MDI now issues MDI_INHIBIT_CLOSE_DESKTOP and MDI_INHIBIT_CLOSE_INSTANCE
   WM_CONTROL messages whenever the desktop or document instance respectively
   is about to be closed. You can use this opportunity to issue a "do you
   want to save" message to the user, if appropriate. Your desktop or document
   window procedure can return TRUE to inhibit the close (for example, if the
   user replies "cancel", or NULL to allow the close. This way, existing programs
   continue to work unchanged.

These bugs are fixed in MDI-13.ARC:

1. The desktop frame was not handling focus changes properly when
   document windows themselves contained controls that manipulated
   the focus. Basically, MDI now handles the WM_ACTIVATE message
   rather than WM_SETFOCUS.

2. In a rather stupid error, some functions that are EXPORTed in MDI.DEF
   were not defined as EXPENTRY. This resulted in errors being flagged
   under the Microsoft OS/2 1.2 debugging kernel. When MDI is compiled
   under MSC 6.0, this error caused the entire DLL to fail.

3. Under MSC 6.0, DATA MULTIPLE is required in the .DEF file if you
   use a C run-time DLL. Because MDI was written this way, the appropriate
   .DEF files have been changed.

4. MSC 6.0 generates a lot more warnings than MSC 5.1 with the same /W3
   compiler option. The MDI source has been updated to eliminate all warnings.

5. A bug existed such that when a desktop containing a maximized document
   was itself maximized, the document was re-sized incorrectly.

6. Previously, when the desktop was re-sized, documents were positioned
   relative to their bottom-left corner (the natural PM way of doing things).
   MDI now repositions documents relative to their top-left corner, much
   like Excel. This seems to be a much more user-friendly technique.

In this version of MDI (MDI-13.ARC), I have removed all the executables
and changed the compile instructions in READ.ME to be more generic,
as different user's environments have varied so widely.
Because MSC 5.1 and 6.0 behave differently, the CRTLIB.DLL and associated
object files are no longer distributed. In any case, all this makes for a
faster download!
