MDI-11.ARC
----------
These bugs have been fixed in MDI-11.ARC:

1. When a document is minimized, a cascade or tile request causes
   areas of "blackness" to be displayed. The problem lies in the
   fact that (under 1.2) there are two windows associated with
   each icon: the icon itself, and its title window.

2. The MDI_NOTIFY_DESTROY_* messages have been expanded. See MDI.H.
   If you use these messages, you should recompile any files that are
   dependant on MDI.H.
