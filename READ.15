ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! ALERT!

Bowing to considerable pressure, the API to MDI has changed slightly in this
release. Unfortunately, this means that any existing programs must be changed
(albeit slightly) and recompiled. The notes below highlight the areas of change.

Remember, you too can have the complete MDI documentation in Quickhelp format
simply by sending $25 to the above address! You'll also become a registered
user and receive periodic updates.

MDI-15.ARC API Changes
----------------------

MDICreateDesktop

The format of the MDICreateDesktop call has changed. The new format is as
follows. Note that the ninth and last parameters are new (marked ***).

   HWND EXPENTRY MDICreateDesktop  (PFNWP, ULONG, PCHAR, HMODULE, USHORT, PHWND, USHORT, USHORT, PCHAR, PCHAR, PCHAR, ULONG);

   // PFNWP   : your desktop window procedure
   // ULONG   : FCF_* flags for the desktop frame
   // PCHAR   : initial desktop title text
   // HMODULE : module handle for resources (or NULL if in .EXE)
   // USHORT  : id of resources
   // PHWND   : pointer to area in which handle to desktop client is returned
   // USHORT  : size of re-entrant desktop data
   // USHORT  : id of desktop frame
***// PCHAR   : text of menu entry before which document menu deltas are inserted
   // PCHAR   : text of menu entry before which the "window" menu entry is inserted
   // PCHAR   : desired text of "window" menu entry
***// ULONG   : mask of options

Prior to this change, document menu deltas were inserted before the "window"
menu entry. However, this made it difficult to support a CUA-style menu
such as:

   File Edit Options Window Help

where "Edit" is a document menu delta. The new ninth parameter allows you
to explictly state the desktop menu item (in this case, "Options") before
which the document menu deltas are to be inserted.

An example of the new MDICreateDesktop call is:

   MDICreateDesktop (DesktopWndProc, flCreateFlags, "MDI Test Program",
     (HMODULE) NULL, IDR_DESKTOP, &hwndDesktop, 0, 1, "Options", "Exit", "~Window", 0L);


MDI_REQUEST_EXTENDED_OPTIONS

The MDI_REQUEST_EXTENDED_OPTIONS message has been removed. Instead, these
options are now specified directly in the MDICreateDesktop call as the last
parameter. In addition, the option masks have been extended to 32-bits for
added flexibility. For completeness, all of the available options are listed
below. Those marked *** are new in this release.

MDI_DISABLE_DESKTOP_POSITION  The retention of desktop position and
                              size information on OS2.INI is
                              disabled.

MDI_DISABLE_DOCUMENT_POSITION The retention of document position and
                              size information on OS2.INI is
                              disabled.

MDI_DISABLE_NEW_DOCUMENT      The "New Document" window menu entry
                              is disabled.

MDI_INITIAL_CASCADE_ALWAYS    The desktop is created in the "cascade
                              always" state

MDI_INITIAL_MAX_DESKTOP       The desktop is created maximized

MDI_INITIAL_TILE_ALWAYS       The desktop is created in the "tile
                              always" state

MDI_KEEP_SCROLLBARS           Any vertical or horizointal scroll bars
                              in document windows are \bnot
                              removed when the document becomes
                              inactive.

MDI_KEEP_WINDOWS_MENU         The "windows" menu is not removed from
                              the desktop menu bar when there are no
                              document windows. In other words, the
                              "windows" menu is always present.

***MDI_ALWAYS_ON_RESIZE       performs a "tile always" or a "cascade always"
                              operation each time the desktop is resized,
                              as well as when a document is created or destroyed.

***MDI_DISABLE_NEW_DOCUMENT   prevents the "new document" entry from
                              appearing in the Window menu.

***MDI_DISABLE_DESKTOP_POSITION disables the memory of desktop position
                              between executions

***MDI_DISABLE_DOCUMENT_POSITION disables the memory of document positions
                              between executions

Note: MDI normally maintains the last known position of the desktop
and its documents on OS2.INI. When the desktop or a document is created,
its last known position and size is used.

An example of the new MDICreateDesktop call is:

   ULONG flOptions = (MDI_KEEP_WINDOWS_MENU | MDI_INITIAL_MAX_DESKTOP | MDI_INITIAL_TILE_ALWAYS
                        | MDI_DISABLE_DESKTOP_POSITION | MDI_ALWAYS_ON_RESIZE | MDI_DISABLE_DOCUMENT_POSITION);

   MDICreateDesktop (DesktopWndProc, flCreateFlags, "MDI Test Program",
     (HMODULE) NULL, IDR_DESKTOP, &hwndDesktop, 0, 1, "Options", "Exit", "~Window", flOptions);


MDICreateDocument

The format of the MDICreateDocument call has changed. The new format is as
follows. Note that the last parameter is new (marked ***).

   HWND EXPENTRY MDICreateDocument (PFNWP, HWND, ULONG, PCHAR, HMODULE, USHORT, PHWND, USHORT, USHORT, USHORT);

   // PFNWP   : your document window procedure
   // HWND    : handle to the desktop client window, as returned by MDICreateDesktop
   // ULONG   : FCF_* flags for the document frame
   // PCHAR   : initial document title
   // HMODULE : module handle for resources (or NULL if in .EXE)
   // USHORT  : id of resources
   // PHWND   : pointer to area in which handle to document client is returned
   // USHORT  : size of re-entrant document data
   // USHORT  : size of re-entrant document instance data
***// USHORT  : id of document frame

In the last parameter, you are expected to code the id of the document frame.
It can be useful to explicitly state the id for help procesing, for example.
Previously, MDI assigned an arbitrary id that you could not change.

An example of the new MDICreateDocument call is:

   MDICreateDocument (WhiteWndProc, hwndDesktop, flCreateFlags,
     "White", (HMODULE) NULL, IDR_WHITE, &hwndDocument, 0, 0, 100);


Windows Menu

Although this is not strictly an API change, an important user interface
change has been made to the "windows" menu. Now, if more than nine document
windows are active, the first nine plus "more..." are listed in the "windows"
menu. Selecting "more..." causes a dialog box showing a list box of all
documents to be displayed. This change has been made to comply with CUA.





MDI-15.ARC Bug Fixes
--------------------

1. "Tile Always" with at least one maximized window leaves a hole in its
   tiling algorithm.

2. The ALT and F10 keys operate inconsistently with respect to highlighting
   the desktop menu

3. MDI causes the desktop window menu bar to flicker excessively when
   inserting a new set of document window menu deltas (as when a new
   document becomes the active window)
